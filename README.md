# 🚀 Intelligent Resume Screening & Ranking System

An AI-powered web application that automates **resume screening and candidate ranking** using Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic similarity, and a customizable weighted scoring framework.

---

## 📌 Overview

Modern recruitment systems struggle with handling large volumes of applications efficiently. Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) rely heavily on **keyword matching**, often ignoring contextual relevance and candidate competency.

This project introduces an **Intelligent Resume Screening System** that:

* Extracts structured information from resumes using NLP
* Evaluates candidates semantically against job descriptions
* Applies a customizable weighted scoring model
* Generates transparent and explainable rankings

📄 Based on research: *“Intelligent Applicant Screening and Ranking with Custom Weighted Scoring”* 

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Based Resume Analysis

* NLP-powered resume parsing using **spaCy (NER)**
* Extracts:

  * Skills
  * Experience
  * Certifications
  * CGPA
  * Projects

### 🔍 Semantic Matching

* TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
* Matches **meaning**, not just keywords
* Handles:

  * Synonyms
  * Contextual relationships

### ⚖️ Custom Weighted Scoring

Flexible evaluation model:

| Parameter      | Description                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Skills         | Technical & domain skill relevance |
| Experience     | Work experience & relevance        |
| CGPA           | Academic performance               |
| Certifications | Professional credentials           |
| Projects       | Practical exposure                 |
| Job Similarity | Semantic alignment with JD         |

✔ Recruiters can adjust weights dynamically

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a **modular pipeline architecture**:

* Resume Input → Preprocessing → NLP Parsing
* Job Description Modeling
* Semantic Similarity Computation
* Weighted Scoring Engine
* Ranking & Comparison Output

📌 End-to-end pipeline ensures:

* Accuracy
* Transparency
* Scalability

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Resume Preprocessing

* PDF → Text conversion
* Cleaning (stopwords, formatting, noise removal)
* Tokenization & normalization

### 2️⃣ NLP-Based Parsing

* Custom **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
* Extracts structured candidate attributes

### 3️⃣ Job Profile Modeling

* Converts job description into structured format:

  * Skills
  * Experience requirements
  * Certifications

### 4️⃣ Semantic Similarity

* TF-IDF vectorization
* Cosine similarity computation

### 5️⃣ Weighted Scoring

Final score computed as:

```
Final Score = Σ (Weight × Feature Score)
```

### 6️⃣ Ranking & Comparison

* Candidates sorted by score
* Resume-to-resume comparison supported
